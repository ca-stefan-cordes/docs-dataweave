`description`, array of possible values (`possibleValues`), an optional default
value (`defaultValue`), and an `optional` flag that indicates whether the property
is required or not.

_Experimental:_ This type is an experimental feature that is subject to change or removal from future versions of DataWeave.


| EvalResult
| `type EvalResult = Result<EvalSuccess, ExecutionFailure&#62;`
| Data type of the data that returns when a `eval` function executes.

_Experimental:_ This type is an experimental feature that is subject to change or removal from future versions of DataWeave.

_Introduced in DataWeave version 2.7.0._


| EvalSuccess
| `type EvalSuccess = { value: Any, logs: Array<LogEntry&#62; }`
| Data type of the data that returns when an `eval` function executes successfully.

_Experimental:_ This type is an experimental feature that is subject to change or removal from future versions of DataWeave.


| ExecutionFailure
| `type ExecutionFailure = { message: String, kind: String, stack?: Array<String&#62;, location: Location, logs: Array<LogEntry&#62; }`
| Data type of the data that returns when a `run` or `eval` function fails.

_Experimental:_ This type is an experimental feature that is subject to change or removal from future versions of DataWeave.


| Location
| `type Location = { start?: Position, end?: Position, locationString: String, text?: String, sourceIdentifier?: String }`
| Type that represents the location of an expression in a DataWeave file.

_Experimental:_ This type is an experimental feature that is subject to change or removal from future versions of DataWeave.


| LogEntry
| `type LogEntry = { level: LogLevel, timestamp: String, message: String }`
| Type for a log entry, which consists of a `level` for a `LogLevel` value,
a `timestamp`, and `message`.

_Experimental:_ This type is an experimental feature that is subject to change or removal from future versions of DataWeave.


| LogLevel
| `type LogLevel = "INFO" &#124; "ERROR" &#124; "WARN"`
| Identifies the different kinds of log levels (`INFO`, `ERROR`, or `WARN`).

_Experimental:_ This type is an experimental feature that is subject to change or removal from future versions of DataWeave.


| LoggerService
| `type LoggerService = { initialize?: &#40;&#41; &#45;&#62; Object, log: &#40;level: LogLevel, msg: String, context: Object&#41; &#45;&#62; Any, shutdown?: &#40;&#41; &#45;&#62; Boolean }`
| Service that handles all logging:

* `initialize`:
   Function called when the execution starts. DataWeave sends
   the result to every `log` call through the `context` parameter,
   so that, for example, a logging header can be sent at
    initialization and recovered in each log.
* `log`:
   Function that is called on every log message.
* `shutdown`:
   Function called when the execution completes, which is a common time
   to flush any buffer or to log out gracefully.

_Experimental:_ This type is an experimental feature that is subject to change or removal from future versions of DataWeave.


| MimeType
| `type MimeType = String`
| A String representation of a MIME type.

_Experimental:_ This type is an experimental feature that is subject to change or removal from future versions of DataWeave.


| Position
| `type Position = { index: Number, line: Number, column: Number }`
| Type that represents a position in a file by its index and its line and column.

_Experimental:_ This type is an experimental feature that is subject to change or removal from future versions of DataWeave.


| ReaderInput
| `type ReaderInput = { value: Binary, encoding?: String, properties?: Dictionary<SimpleType&#62;, mimeType: MimeType }`
| Input to the DataWeave reader created for the specified MIME type, which includes
the Binary input and MIME type, as well as optional encoding and properties values.

* `value`: The input, in Binary format.
* `encoding`: The encoding for the reader to use.
* `properties`: The reader properties used to parse the input.
* `mimeType`: The MIME type of the input.

_Experimental:_ This type is an experimental feature that is subject to change or removal from future versions of DataWeave.


| RunResult
| `type RunResult = Result<RunSuccess, ExecutionFailure&#62;`
| Data type of the data that returns when a `run` function executes.

_Experimental:_ This type is an experimental feature that is subject to change or removal from future versions of DataWeave.

_Introduced in DataWeave version 2.7.0._


| RunSuccess
| `type RunSuccess = { value: Binary, mimeType: MimeType, encoding?: String, logs: Array<LogEntry&#62; }`
| Data type of the data that returns when a `run` function executes successfully.

_Experimental:_ This type is an experimental feature that is subject to change or removal from future versions of DataWeave.


| RuntimeExecutionConfiguration
| `type RuntimeExecutionConfiguration = { timeOut?: Number, outputMimeType?: MimeType, writerProperties?: Dictionary<SimpleType&#62;, onException?: "HANDLE" &#124; "FAIL", securityManager?: SecurityManager, loggerService?: LoggerService, maxStackSize?: Number, onUnhandledTimeout?: &#40;threadName: String, javaStackTrace: String, code: String&#41; &#45;&#62; Any }`
| Configuration of the runtime execution that has advanced parameters.

* `timeOut`:
   Maximum amount of time the DataWeave script takes before timing out.

* `outputMimeType`:
  Default output MIME type if not specified in the DataWeave script.

* `writerProperties`:
   Writer properties to use with the specified the `outputMimeType` property.

* `onException`
  Specifies the behavior that occurs when the execution fails:
  ** `HANDLE` (default value) returns `ExecutionFailure`.
  ** `FAIL` propagates an exception.

* `securityManager`:
  Identifies the `SecurityManager` to use in this execution. This security manager
  is composed by the current `SecurityManager`.

* `loggerService`:
  The `LoggerService` to use in this execution.
* `maxStackSize`:
  The maximum stack size.

* `onUnhandledTimeout`:
 Callback that is called when the watchdog was not able to stop the execution
 after a timeout, which is useful for logging or reporting the problem.
 The callback is called with the following:
** `threadName`:  Name of the thread that hanged.
** `javaStackTrace`: Java stack trace where the hang occurred.
** `code`: The DataWeave code that caused the hang.

_Experimental:_ This type is an experimental feature that is subject to change or removal from future versions of DataWeave.


| SecurityManager
| `type SecurityManager = &#40;grant: String, args: Array<Any&#62;&#41; &#45;&#62; Boolean`
| Function that is called when a privilege must be granted to the current execution.

* `grant` is the name of the privilege, such as `Resource`.
* `args` provides a list of parameters that the function requesting the privilege calls.

_Experimental:_ This type is an experimental feature that is subject to change or removal from future versions of DataWeave.


| TryResult
| `type TryResult = Result<T, TryResultFailure&#62;`
| Object with a result or error message. If `success` is `false`, data type provides
the `error`. If `true`, the data type provides the `result`.


| TryResultFailure
| `type TryResultFailure = { kind: String, message: String, stack?: Array<String&#62;, stackTrace?: String, location?: String }`
| A type for representing failed execution from `try`.

Supports the following fields:

* `kind`: The error kind.
* `message`: The error message.
* `stack`: The stacktrace error (optional).
* `stackTrace`: The stacktrace string value representation (optional).
* `location`: The error location (optional).

Starting in Mule 4.4.0, if the stack is not present, the `stackTrace` field is available
with the native Java stack trace.

_Introduced in DataWeave version 2.7.0._
